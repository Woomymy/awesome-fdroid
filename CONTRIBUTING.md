# Contributing to awesome-fdroid

## Pull request rules

- You must add **one link** by pull request
- Your title must be something like `Add $project_name ($short_description)`

## Adding a link

Add a link in the right section, with a short and concise description. If you don't know where to put your app, add it in the "Other" section. 

Link syntax:

`* [project_name](https://f-droid.org/packages/$appid) - $description`

If needed, add the section with a "h2" heading (`##`) and add its link the Table of contents

Thanks, all your contributions are welcome!
